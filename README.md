SmartAttendanceManagement (SAM) is an automated facial recognition attendance system which can work without any requirement of man-power to handle the data.
This project works in such a way that, the system runs and starts the facial recognition process at a fixed time interval in every period or hour. 
When a registered person tries to mark their attendance, the system recognizes their face and marks as "Present", else "Absent".
If the person was present in the previous period of attendance and absent in the current period, they are marked as "Bunked". 
We developed the system in such a way that it calculates the attendance percentage of a class or an individual on a daily,weekly, monthly and yearly basis.
This is an automated and independent system which requires no human interaction for handling the internal data.
